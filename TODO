* satellite orbit PoC & OpenGL goals
  - [X] grok OpenGL Programming Manual thru chap 5 (up to textures)
  - [X] grok VAOs and VBOs
  - [X] how to provide OpenGL with data?
  - [X] tinker with the various ways OpenGL can draw
  - [X] draw triangle in NDC
  - [X] draw cube in NDC
  - [X] scale / rotate / translate cube (by hand)
  - [X] change color of cube via uniform variables (by hand)
  - [X] grok homogenous coordinates
  - [X] grok various coordinate spaces
  - [X] grok various coordinate space transforms
  - [X] grok the projection matrix
  - [X] load simple model from Blender
  - [X] make a fully 3d scene with a couple of objects placed on a floor
  - [X] be able to use the ps4 controller to move around like doom
  - [X] be able to load models from blender and place them into your scene
  - [X] grok textures
  - [X] be able to load materials from blender
  - [ ] grok lighting
  - [ ] place multiple different types of light around the scene
  - [ ] add some simple physics for a two-player game of 3d pong
  - [ ] render text from opengl
  - [ ] try to understand the best way to organize opengl code
  - [X] try creating a world-sized sphere and mapping mars' surface onto it
  - [ ] try putting a satellite into orbit
    - [ ] try having the camera follow the satellite's orbit
  - [ ] understand the camera transform more fully
  - [ ] understand the projection transfor more fully
    - [ ] it seems trying different FoV angles flips the view
  - [ ] try making a spaceship and flying it around
    - [ ] requires all degrees of freedom
    - [ ] and some physics
    - [ ] and probably quaternions
